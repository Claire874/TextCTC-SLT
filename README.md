# TextCTC-SLT (COLING2025)
Implementation of paper "Improvement in Sign Language Translation Using Text CTC Alignment"

---
### Paper Highlights
Unlike other sign language translation(SLT) technique which limits the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for sign langauge translation (SLT). Our work, however, fully explores CTC capacity for non-monotic alignment between sign language and spoken text for SLT.


 Briefly,
- We propose leveraging a **joint CTC/Attention framework** combined with **transfer learning** to address the unique challenges of SLT, particularly the modality gap between visual sign language and spoken text. Compared with speech and text translation, SLT requires handling more complex spatial-temporal representations and addressing non-monotonic alignments to grasp the linguistic feature embedded in sign language.
- The proposed method achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art, outperforming the pure-attention baseline on widely adopted benchmarks, RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 T and CSL-Daily.
- We offer a promising direction for future research by exploring the potential of **text CTC alignment for gloss-free SLT**.
